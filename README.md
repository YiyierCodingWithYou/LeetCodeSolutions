250918 Easy - TwoSum: implement O(n) solution using Dictionary  
250918 Easy - Palindrome Number: implement two solutions (reverse string, half string comparison)  
250919 Easy - Roman to Integer: implement solution using right-to-left traversal and lastInteger comparison  
250919 Easy - Longest Common Prefix: implement two solutions (vertical scan using shortest string length, horizontal scan by shrinking base string)  
250921 Med. - Add Two Numbers: add two numbers represented as reversed linked lists using per-node addition with carry  
250923 Easy - Valid Parentheses: implement stack-based solution to validate bracket matching and order  
250925 Easy - Merge Two Sorted Lists: implement two solutions (A: collect + sort, B: in-place merge by pointer comparison)  
250930 Easy - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: implement two-pointer solution to overwrite duplicates in-place and return unique count  
250930 Easy - Remove Element: implement two-pointer overwrite method  
250930 Easy - Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String: implement substring sliding window search  
251002 Med. - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: implement sliding window with HashSet to track duplicates and adjust window  
251002 Easy - Score of a String: implement loop to sum absolute ASCII differences of adjacent characters  
251006 Med. - Longest Palindromic Substring: implement expand-around-center approach to find the longest palindrome substring  
251009 Easy - Search Insert Position: implement binary search to find target index or insertion position in sorted array  
251009 Easy - Length of Last Word: implement Trim and Split to return the length of the last word  
251009 Easy - Plus One: implement right-to-left array addition to increment a large integer by one  
251012 Med. - Zigzag Conversion: implement efficient string rearrangement using row tracking and string.Concat for final result   
251016 Easy - Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference: use a loop to sum numbers not divisible by m and numbers divisible by m separately, then return the difference  
251016 Easy - Build Array from Permutation: create a new array where each element is nums[nums[i]] by iterating through the original array  
251021 Med. - Merge Intervals: sort intervals by start value, merge overlapping ones  
251021 Med. - 3Sum: use sorting + two-pointer approach to find all unique triplets summing to zero  
251023 Easy - Add Binary: used two pointers to simulate binary addition from the end of the strings, added digits with carry handling, and reversed the result string to get the correct output  
251023 Easy - Sqrt(x): use binary search to find the largest integer whose square ≤ x; avoid overflow by casting mid to long during comparison  
251101 Easy - Climbing Stairs: calculate the number of distinct ways to reach the top of a staircase where each step can be 1 or 2, using dynamic programming  
251101 Easy - Remove Duplicates from Sorted List: Traverse the sorted linked list with a single pointer, skipping nodes with duplicate values to remove duplicates  
251103 Easy - Find the Maximum Achievable Number: derive x = num + 2 × t based on maximum relative movement of 2 per operation; return num + 2 * t  
251103 Easy - Concatenation of Array: create a new array of size 2n and fill it using a conditional check  
251106 Med. - Integer to Roman: build mapping table of values and symbols, iterate from largest to smallest value, append corresponding Roman symbols while subtracting from num, and return the concatenated result  
251113 Easy - Same Tree: recursively compare two binary trees by checking null conditions, value equality, and subtree equivalence  
251113 Med. - Reverse Integer: implemented both string-based and math-based approaches with overflow handling
